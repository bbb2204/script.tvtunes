* Download themes from a selection of differrent websites
* Play video themes in addition to audio themes
* Screensaver that plays the themes and shows fanart, cast and thumbnails (See: [TvTunesScreensaver](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:TvTunesScreensaver))

It is a feature rich and very configurable addon with numerous settings to allow you to fine-tune it to your own requirements.

You can install this addon from: [Repository:robwebset](https://github.com/robwebset/repository.robwebset/blob/master/repos/repository.robwebset/repository.robwebset-1.0.0.zip) ([wiki](http://kodi.wiki/view/Repository:robwebset))

__Important If You Use Confluence (Kodi v15.2 Only)__

If you update to Kodi 15.2 and use confluence with TvTunes, you may notice that Confluence looks pretty awful when a theme starts playing. This was due to:

To get it looking nice again, download the following zip and install it just like any other addon, then restart Kodi.
